# Shooting-method
The code can be used to numerically solve n'th order Ordinary differential equation using RK1, RK2, RK4 
explicit, implicit and predictor corrector schemes. It can also be used to solve boundary value  
and eigen value problems using shooting method. 


Some examples are included 
(1) Kepler motion.
(2) Particle in a box Boundary Value Problem.
(3) Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Boundary Value Problem.
