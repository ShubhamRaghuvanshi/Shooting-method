# Shooting-method
The code can be used to numerically solve n'th order Ordinary differential equation and boundary value problems. Using RK1, RK2, RK4 
explicit, implicit and predictor corrector schemes.

Some examples are included 
(1) Kepler motion.
(2) Particle in a box Boundary Value Problem.
(3) Quantum Harmonic Oscillator Boundary Value Problem.
